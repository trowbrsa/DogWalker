# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# seed_owners = [
# {first_name: "Pope", last_name: "Francis", bio: "I am a very busy man and won't have time to walk dogs. If you're feeling holy, please get in touch.", user_id: 1},
# {first_name: "Ruth", last_name: "Bader Ginsburg", bio: "Where I work, I sadly cannot bring dogs in. I would love for you walk my dog while I am away.", user_id: 2},
